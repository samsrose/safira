<h3>Safira - Free Ghost Theme</h3>

Safira is a very simple ghost blog theme. It is fully responsive and based on bootstrap 3 for it's main grid. Looks great on tablets and mobile phones. It has all the ghost 
necessary styles, for paragraphs, lists, images, text inputs, hr's quotes, and code commenting. The user is highlighted on the home page for each post or on the post page at the bottom of the content. 
Under the content lies the navigation on a ribbon like line content along side of social icons. At the very bottom there is the footer containing standard copyright text and blog link. The theme comes 
with a default logo and has all the links and dates a washed up red. Not to opaque, not too bright. All the content is centered inside the post and in the home page loop of posts.
